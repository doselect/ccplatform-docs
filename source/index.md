# Content creator's Guide

Each problem should contain the following information:

### Problem name
Some fancy name for the problem. If the problems are part of a hackathon, the name should go along with the theme of the hackathon.
### Problem statement
This explains the problem. The problem description should be interesting and easy to follow.
### Input format
The description of input for the problem. This should also contain constraints.
### Output format
The format of the Output
### Sample test cases
Sample input test cases which will give better understanding
### Editorial
Explanation of solution to the problem.
### Solution
The solution code in any accepted language. It should be commented
### Difficulty of the problem
One of the following

* **Easy:** This kind of problem should be easily solvable by anyone who is familiar with basic data structures and algorithms. The approach for the solution should be obvious from the problem statement.
**Success rate:** 80%
* **Medium:** This kind of problem should require knowledge of advanced data structures and algorithms like Dynamic Programming, Greedy algorithms, Graph traversal, etc.
**Success rate:** 50%
* **Hard:** This kind of problem should require experience in competitive programming along with knowledge of advance programming concepts.
**Success rate:** 20%

### Tags
Math, String manipulation, Graph, Dynamic programming, API
### Test cases

* **Description of each test case and test generator** if using random in test case generator, make sure to use fixed seed to generate same test cases
* **Input file(s):** 1 or more input files
* **Output file(s):** 1 or more output files
* **Testing script (optional):** The test script which will be used to evaluate the solution (for example, in case of OS state evaluation)

###Time limit
Approximate time limit for the code run

## Guidelines for creating a new problem

* Try to base the problem on some practical use cases so that it becomes interesting and candidates get to learn something new in the process
* The problem should not be copied from other websites
* The solution should not be easily available on the internet
* The problem statement should be written in simple language so that there is no ambiguity

## Notes

* Input test cases should cover all corner cases so that the accepted solutions are correct
* Input test cases should contain easy test cases also so that users can get partial score for thie attempt
