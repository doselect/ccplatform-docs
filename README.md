* **Write code samples in multiple languages** â€” if your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with Github Flavored Markdown!



<!--As an example, you can check out the [TripIt API docs](http://tripit.github.io/api), which we create with Slate. You can also view the source of the [markdown file used to generate it](http://github.com/tripit/api/blob/master/source/index.md).-->
